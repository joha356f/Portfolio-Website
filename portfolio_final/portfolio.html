        This topic consisted of two big projects: the semester start exam website and the 'emnesite'. We were introduced to basic HTML and CSS aswell as FileZilla. In the first project we were given layout diagrammes & wireframes to follow but
        freedom in design through CSS. The second project was similar but with far more freedom. We could apply all the skills we had learnt and create a website - where we could choose the subject. I enjoyed this topic - I felt confident in my
        abilities after a short amount of time, and the things that had felt so overwhelming to begin with quickly began to flow.

          'Save The Bees' was the second website I made. Here we were able to learn about some design principles, as we had to make a moodboard and a style tile for the site. I wanted to portray a mixture of retro style and swiss style in my site. I
          made the background for the site on Adobe XD, which was also the first opportunity I had to experiment with that program.

        In this topic we were challenged to think about how users interact with and experience a product. We designed our own clothing brand, where we learnt about design concepts and the idea process in depth. We were also introduced to several
        research methods, which we used to gather information for our brand. I wanted to create a sustainable clothing brand for young, creative people - with this in mind I started with some desk reserach which gave me a broader understanding. I
        then did obersvational research, an interview and a survey. My research findings are below in a google slides document.

        After I had plenty of information from my research, I started sketching ideas for my brand where I used the 'Crazy 8' technique to prompt some ideas. Then I began experimenting on Adobe XD to make some mock-ups, where you are able to link
        artboards to depict pop-ups or linked pages. I made a moodboard and style tile, aswell as a frontpage, shop page and a prouct view page.

        In this topic we were challenged to design and program a videogame. We started by brainstorming ideas, making paper prototypes and sketches of the game elements. We then used Adobe Illustrator to draw the designs and exported them as SVG
        files. The design process of this topic has definitely been my favourite part of the semester, I really enjoyed learning about Adobe Illustrator and experimenting with all the possibilities. When we had our exported game elements, we began to
        code. We were then introduced to JavaScript, which we used to make our game elements interactive. This was definitely the most challenging part of the course for me, however learning JavaScript opened up lots of opportunities that I have now
        used in other projects. For instance the burger menu and scrolling action on this website.

        In this topic we learnt about video production and post-production of photos and footage. We were also introduced to the Tech Lounge, where we could borrow equiptment. We had two big projects within this topic - the first was a one minute
        long video about a specific passion. We chose to interview Hjalte, who has a passion for rollerblading. We used a DJI osmo pocket to record the footage and a RØDE clip-on microphone for the audio. I then used Premiere Pro to edit the footage
        afterwards. In the second project we were to make a promotional video for a brand/company and a re-design of their website in a group. We chose the company 'Outdoor Action', as we thought that their website was a little complicated. I
        re-designed the 'inspiration' page. We were also introduced to GitHub here, which allowed us all to work on one website simultaniously. Below is a documentation of the entire process, aswell as the videos & websites we made.

      I enjoyed creating and editing video content in this topic. However, it was a little challenging working as a group, with so many ideas being thrown around. We made a trello board to organise the workload, however it quickly became confusing
      and was disreguarded. In the future I will make sure to voice my opinions more in the meetings. GitHub is a fantastic tool when it comes to coding in a group projects, we had very few issues with overwriting eachother.
