          My name is Dana Vennerstrøm Johnson, I am 21 years old and I am just finishing my first semester of multimediadesign at KEA. I am half english and have lived in London for most of my life. In 2018 I moved to Denmark where I studied I.B. at
          Nyborg Gymnasium. After I finished gymnasium I studied art at C level and worked in a kindergarden.

          I lived in Odense for a year, where I volunteered at a concert & event organisation called Røde Himmel. Here I made posters for concerts, which opened some exciting opportunities working with inspiring people and amazing printing machines.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been very creative and enjoyed drawing, painting and really any kind of creative expression. I decided to start multimediadesign because I thought it would be an exciting step towards the future I'd like to build for myself. I
          thought it would be a great way to broaden my creative skills and open them up to a digital world.
        </p>

          After this first semester I can build my own website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I can use programs such as Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator with ease. I have moderate Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Adobe Audition skills. I feel that I have a
          drive that pushes me to experiment and learn new skills.
        </p>

          This past year my parents have started a bed & breakfast in Svendborg, where I have worked a lot with them on their social media presence and had opportunities to work with webdesigners and graphic designers. I find this kind of work very
          exciting and rewarding. I love being able to apply the skills that I have learnt this semester in real projects outside of school and am excited for the projects to come.
